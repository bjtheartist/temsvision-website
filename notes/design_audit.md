# Design Audit - BJ Product Design Portfolio

## Goal: Achieve a bespoke, high-end design studio feel

### Current Issues Identified:

#### 1. **Hero Section**
- Badge "PRODUCT DESIGNER & CREATIVE" feels generic
- Too many decorative blur elements
- Scroll indicator is basic
- Could use more refined entrance animation

#### 2. **Marquee/Ticker**
- Feels noisy and distracting
- Common pattern that doesn't feel bespoke
- Consider removing or making more subtle

#### 3. **Portfolio Section**
- "TAP TO FLIP" text is noisy
- Too many tags on cards
- Bento grid is good but cards could be cleaner
- Filter buttons could be more refined
- "VIEW ALL PROJECTS" button feels unnecessary

#### 4. **Services Section**
- Accordion works but image preview feels disconnected
- Pricing displayed prominently - consider if this is desired
- Feature tags feel cluttered

#### 5. **About Section**
- Skills tags feel like a list dump
- Could be more editorial/storytelling focused
- "7+ YEARS EXPERIENCE" stat is good but placement feels random

#### 6. **Contact Section**
- Form is functional but basic
- Social links feel like an afterthought
- "FOLLOW ME" label is generic

#### 7. **Overall**
- Custom cursor is nice but common
- Theme toggle is functional
- Too many uppercase labels
- Inconsistent spacing
- Some animations feel busy rather than purposeful

### Refinements to Make:

1. **Add elegant preloader** - Simple, typographic, sets the tone
2. **Remove marquee ticker** - Adds noise without value
3. **Simplify portfolio cards** - Remove "TAP TO FLIP", reduce tags
4. **Refine typography** - More consistent sizing, better hierarchy
5. **Increase whitespace** - Let elements breathe
6. **Simplify color usage** - Stick to black/white with one accent
7. **Reduce labels** - Remove unnecessary "SELECTED WORK", "WHAT I OFFER" etc.
8. **Polish animations** - Slower, more intentional, less bouncy
9. **Simplify services** - Remove pricing if not needed, cleaner layout
10. **Editorial about section** - Less tags, more storytelling
