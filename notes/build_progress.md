## Current Status: Working

The portfolio is now running and displaying correctly with the following sections:

### Completed Components:

1. **Hero Section** - Large typography with "BILLY NDIZEYE" name, animated gradient background, CTAs
2. **Navbar** - Fixed navigation with smooth scroll to sections, theme toggle
3. **Marquee Ticker** - Animated text showing services
4. **Portfolio Section** - Bento grid layout with 8 projects, filter tabs, flip cards
5. **Services Section** - Accordion-style service listings with pricing
6. **About Section** - Bio, skills tags, experience stats, CTAs
7. **Contact Section** - Contact form, social links, email/location info
8. **Footer** - Social links, back to top button, copyright

### Design Patterns Implemented (from research):

- Bento grid portfolio layout (Bureau VA inspired)
- Flip card interactions
- Filter tabs for portfolio
- Service accordion with dynamic image preview

3. Improve mobile responsiveness
4. Add project detail pages/modals
5. Enhance loading states
6. Add more sophisticated animations
7. Consider adding a testimonials section
8. Add case study functionality

### Technical Stack:
