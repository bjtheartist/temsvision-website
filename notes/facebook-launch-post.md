# Facebook Launch Post - TemsVision

## Option 1: Personal & Story-Driven

---

Just shipped something I'm proud of.

My friend Temi (@TemsVision) is a photographer with serious talent—portraits, fashion, jerseys, weddings, the works. She needed a website that matched her vision.

10 days ago, we started with a blank canvas. Today, www.temsvision.com is live.

The process reminded me why I love building:
- Start with research (studied portfolios I admired)
- Design with intention (every detail matters)
- Ship iteratively (don't wait for perfect)
- Celebrate the wins

If you're sitting on a project waiting to be "ready"—just start. The momentum builds itself.

Check out Temi's work. She's booking for 2026.

## Option 2: Community-Focused

---

Built a portfolio website for @TemsVision and it's live!

Temi is a Nigerian-American photographer based in Atlanta capturing everything from creative portraits to custom jerseys to weddings.

What I love about this project:
→ Her authentic voice shines through
→ The gallery actually makes you want to explore
→ Mobile-first (because that's where people browse)
→ From concept to deployed in 10 days

Sometimes the best projects come from helping talented people share their work with the world.

Go show her some love: www.temsvision.com
